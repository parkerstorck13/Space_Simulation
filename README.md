# Space_Simulation

This is a simple 2D simulation representing an object in space. It was built using Python and Pygame.

How To Use:
-You will need to have Pygame on your machine
-The arrow keys will accelerate the rocket in the desired direction
-Pressing the 'r' key will reset the simulation
-Pressing the 'esc' key, the 'q' key or the GUI 'X' button will close the program
-Pressing the 'o' key will zoom the simulation out
-Pressing the 'i' key will zoom the simulation in

Possible Additions:
-Add XY-Axis to better show position
-Add pause function to stop rocket during sim
-Add menu at start of program 
-Add small diagram to show acceleration of rocket(possibly in corner)
